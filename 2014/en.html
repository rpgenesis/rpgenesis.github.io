		<p><b>RPGenesis</b> is an international event for the creation and the promotion of roleplaying games. Without depending on publishers, every year participants have a week to develop their games – and this year, just like in 2013, we take things a step forward.
		There will not only be the traditional <b>Author’s Week</b>, where a new game is created with, at least, 5.000 words, but also the <b>Editor’s Week</b>, where participants can further develop past or present projects.
		Like in the previous years, there will be no prizes or official judges – instead, there will be the power of a strong community, always there to supply copious amounts of motivation and help, in order to both create something new, and push forward projects that draw our personal interest.</p>
		<h3 id="editores">Editor's Week</h3>
		<p>From the <b>11th to the 17th</b> August, each participant will have 7 days to create something for an already existing RPG – be it reviewing, translating or expanding an existing game, or even creating new adventures, settings, rules or demonstration material for it – whatever it takes to further the cause of your RPG of choice. Note that if you chose a game created by someone else, you will need to have the author’s permission to do so. It’s possible to simply write, but you can also draw, take pictures, program, promote, engage in performing arts, or even sing – whatever it takes for an editor to develop or promote an RPG.</p>
		<h3 id="autores">Author's Week</h3>
		<p>From the <b>25th to the 31st</b> of August, each participant will have 7 days to write at least 5.000 words for a new RPG. This is a challenge that many have beaten before since 2010. The goal is to write, write, write – getting fresh ideas to paper now, so you can review and clean up later; playing with words, experimenting new systems and entering alternative universes – leaving doubts and hesitations for next year’s Editor’s Week, and dare to write without fear, i.e. to do anything an author would do to get a finished first draft of a game.</p>
